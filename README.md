# RoomReady

Mobile-first housekeeping app for a fixed 62-room property (101-121, 201-221, 301-320).

On open, the app asks who's using the device:

- **Front Desk** — a read-only board showing the status of every room.
- **Housekeeping** — the same board, but tapping a room lets you set its status.

Statuses are **Needs Cleaning** (yellow), **Out of Order** (red), and **Clean** (green). Every phone
sees a change instantly, and a push notification goes out whenever a room's status changes. Tap
**Switch** in the header to change roles.

## Finding a room

Rooms are grouped into collapsible **floor sections**, closed by default. Each floor header shows how
many rooms it holds and a colored count per status, so the board fits on one screen without scrolling.

The **search box** filters as you type, and each digit narrows the list: `21` → 121 and 210-219;
`214` → one room. It matches the digits anywhere in the room number, so `14` finds 114, 214, and 314.
Non-digits are ignored.

The three **counters at the top are the status filter**: tap "Out of Order" to see only those rooms,
tap it again to go back to all. Searching or filtering opens every floor automatically, so a match is
never hidden inside a collapsed section.

## Running it right now (demo mode)

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

With no Firebase config present the app runs in **demo mode**: it seeds all 62 rooms and stores
everything in that browser's `localStorage`. Nothing syncs between phones and no notifications are
sent — it's just there so you can see and click through the interface before setting up a backend.

## Making it real (Firebase setup)

You have to do these steps yourself since they're tied to your Google account.

1. **Create the project** — go to the Firebase console and create a new project (free Spark plan is
   fine to start; Cloud Functions requires upgrading to the pay-as-you-go Blaze plan, which still
   costs ~$0 at this volume).
2. **Add a Web app** to the project. Copy the config values it shows you.
3. **Enable Firestore** (start in production mode) and **enable Anonymous authentication** under
   Authentication → Sign-in method.
4. **Get a Web Push certificate** — Project settings → Cloud Messaging → Web configuration →
   generate a key pair. That's your VAPID key.
5. **Fill in your env file**:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Paste in the values from steps 2 and 4, and pick a `VITE_APP_PASSCODE` for your staff.
6. **Deploy the rules, function, and site**:
   ```
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   firebase login
   firebase use --add          # select your project
   npm --prefix functions install
   npm run build
   firebase deploy
   ```

## How access works

- `VITE_APP_PASSCODE` is a **convenience gate** — it stops someone who stumbles onto the URL from
  poking around. It is not real security, because the passcode ships in the client bundle.
- The actual boundary is `firestore.rules`, which requires an authenticated (anonymous) session.
- If you later want real accountability — knowing which specific housekeeper did what, and being
  able to revoke one person's access — swap anonymous auth for per-user email/password accounts.
  The UI already records a name with each change; it's just self-reported today.

## Notifications

`functions/index.js` watches the `rooms` collection. When a room's `status` field changes, it pushes
a notification to every device registered in `deviceTokens`.

**Not wired into the UI right now.** The "Notify me" button was removed, so no device registers a
token and nothing is sent. The plumbing is still in the repo — `src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`,
`public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`, and the Cloud Function — so switching it back on means rendering a
button that calls `useNotifications().enable()`, filling in `VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY`, and upgrading
the project to the Blaze plan so Cloud Functions can deploy.

- **Android / desktop Chrome**: works from the browser directly.
- **iPhone**: you must first add the app to your Home Screen (Share → Add to Home Screen) and open
  it from that icon. iOS only permits web push for installed web apps (iOS 16.4+).

Right now *every* registered device gets notified, including the housekeeper who made the change.
If you only want your own phone to be notified, mark your device's token as the owner one and filter
the recipient list in the Cloud Function.

## The room list

The 62 rooms are fixed in code — there is no add or remove room in the UI. The first time the app
connects to an empty Firestore project it creates the missing room documents (one per number, using
the room number as the document ID) and marks them Clean. Anything else in the `rooms` collection is
ignored.

To change the property's room list, edit `ROOM_NUMBERS` in `src/types.ts`; new numbers get created
on the next load.
